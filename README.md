#gingerbread_map

Simple python implementation of the Gingerbreadman map. See https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gingerbreadman_map for more information about the Gingerbreadman map

Run gingerbread.py and you will be prompted to enter in the number of points for your initial random array of coordinates and the number of iterations to apply the Gingerbreadman map. This will create a screen showing two graphs with the inital configuration of points next to the final configuration of points.
